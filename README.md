This is a CAD model of a coaxial swerve drive. 
This swerve drive is a little different compared to normal coaxial drive because it uses omni wheels instead of traction wheels to gain theoretically infinite speed. 
Each diagonal set of wheels are locked to each other, so only two turning motors are needed.
